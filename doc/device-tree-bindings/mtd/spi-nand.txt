SPI NAND flash

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "spi-nand"
- reg: should encode the chip-select line used to access the NAND chip

Optional properties
- spi-max-frequency: maximum frequency of the SPI bus the chip can operate at.
		     This should encode board limitations (i.e. max freq can't
		     be achieved due to crosstalk on IO lines).
		     When unspecified, the driver assumes the chip can run at
		     the max frequency defined in the spec (information
		     extracted chip detection time).
- spi-tx-bus-width: The bus width (number of data wires) that is used for MOSI.
		    Only encodes the board constraints (i.e. when not all IO
		    signals are routed on the board). Device constraints are
		    extracted when detecting the chip, and controller
		    constraints are exposed by the SPI mem controller. If this
		    property is missing that means no constraint at the board
		    level.
- spi-rx-bus-width: The bus width (number of data wires) that is used for MISO.
		    Only encodes the board constraints (i.e. when not all IO
		    signals are routed on the board). Device constraints are
		    extracted when detecting the chip, and controller
		    constraints are exposed by the SPI mem controller. If this
		    property is missing that means no constraint at the board
		    level.
